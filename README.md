# HW13 

This homework builds upon the concepts and techniques used in Programming 4B. The goal of the homework was to incorporate serial inputs from an Arduino device to dynamically control visual elements on a canvas. Specifically, this implementation utilizes a button and a potentiometer as inputs to interactively modify the appearance of a pyramid-like figure rendered on the canvas.

The button input is programmed to change the colors of the various shapes that make up the figure. Each time the button is pressed, the colors cycle through predefined values, resulting in a visually dynamic and interactive experience. This functionality demonstrates the ability to process and respond to discrete, digital inputs in real-time.

The potentiometer input controls the size of the figure. By rotating the potentiometer, the user can increase or decrease the size of the shapes proportionally. This introduces an analog control mechanism to the homework, showcasing how continuous inputs can be effectively utilized to modify visual attributes. The smooth resizing of the figure provides a tangible demonstration of how analog values from a sensor can be mapped to graphical properties in a creative application.
